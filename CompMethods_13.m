%% TESTING SECTION- Plot and finding peaks

% In this section I have just been messing around with the time_vector and
% velocity vector that we found from before in an attempt to see if those
% values can allow us to recognize where there is a heart beat.  I tried
% using the value of .07 as a baseline for the speed where the heart moves
% into the ROI and then moves out.  Looking at the plot visually it looks
% like there are roughly 44-45 peaks but that is up for interpretation
% which is bad haha.  But if that is true and each peak measures when the
% heart moves into and then out of the ROI that would be good because
% watching the video I count 22 beats during the 13 second video which
% would match up with the 44 peaks...  Unfortunately using findpeaks on the
% velocity variable gave me 92 peaks that were above the .07 threshold.

test_vector= ones(length(time_vector));

test_vector= test_vector.*.7;

plot(time_vector, diff_max_vel, time_vector, test_vector)
% locs is the indices of each maximum
% MinPeakProminence makes it so maxima have to be at least .08 higher than
% the other peaks -Brendan
[peak2,locs]= findpeaks(diff_max_vel,time_vector,'MinPeakProminence',.08)
% On my code this reduced it from 290 to 46 columns of peak2.

% Find number of heart beats
heartbeats = length(peak2)/2;
test_find= find(peak2 >= .7)

counter= 0

for ii= 1:length(peak2)
    if peak2(ii)>=.7
